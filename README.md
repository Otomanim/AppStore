<h3 p align="center"> Inspired by the app Store, I recreated its entire architecture using the view collection in different formats and with customized cells.

Project entirely in viewcode in the native Swift language, I implemented some random color and viewpreview codes to facilitate development, all cells are created by reading a json file, object orientation being done using the protocol method, constraints with methods similar to SwiftUI
